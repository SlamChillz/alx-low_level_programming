# Function pointers
The objectives of this project are:
- What are function pointers and how to use them
- What does a function pointer exactly hold
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

### 0. What's my name
[0-print_name.c](./0-print_name.c) a function that prints a name.
- Prototype: `void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *))
